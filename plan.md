Server file:
Test Server connection ✅
Allow access control from localhost:3000 for frontend to request from this server. ✅
Establish 3 api calls - one for the fizz numbers, one buzz and one for fizzbuzz?
Create a Json file with all numbers in. ✅


Todays plan:  
- Populate JSON. ✅
- On mount, render all numbers on screen (to be later formatted), ✅
- Format into try-catch and with suitable error codes: ✅
  - Error for no data or fail to parse. ✅
  - Error for no response code 500 ✅
  - 200 code for success. ✅



Plan for session 3
- Install bootstrap and make card component for each number, map over component. ✅
- Make a container div, row, flex box with flex-wrap on. ✅

- Write 3 api calls for fizz buzz and fizz buzz - all manipulate copies of the JSON rather than the JSON file itself. 



For next session:
 - Debug the handleFizzBuzz function - see why numbers are not being transformed (possible issue with types.) ✅
 - Complete other 2 functions and endpoints. ✅

 Plan for this session:
- Quick bit of debugging, see if the code is returning original array or the array is not being modified. ✅
- Finish other 2 api endpoints ✅
- Write instructions for how to use and neaten up code/neaten up comments. ✅
- Neaten up CSS. ✅
