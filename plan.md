Server file:
Test Server connection ✅
Allow access control from localhost:3000 for frontend to request from this server. ✅
Establish 3 api calls - one for the fizz numbers, one buzz and one for fizzbuzz?
Create a Json file with all numbers in. 


Todays plan:  
- Populate JSON.
- On mount, render all numbers on screen (to be later formatted),
- Write 3 api calls for fizz buzz and fizz buzz - all manipulate copies of the JSON rather than the JSON file itself.
- Format into try-catch and with suitable error codes.
